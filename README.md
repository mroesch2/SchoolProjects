Projects created while attending Tennessee Tech

CyberPatriot: Unplugged was a term project for CSC 4575 created by Julienne Cox and me during our Spring 2019 semester

x86 Assembly Projects done during the Fall 2019 semester

OCaml Program completed Fall 2019 for CSC 2710

Operating Systems programs comleted Spring 2020 for CSC 4100

Due to my senior project being property of Tennessee Tech and possibly ongoing, I'm not sure I'm allowed to add the code here. Instead, I added a PDF of one of our iteration reports to show what kind of work was being done during our 2 week sprints
